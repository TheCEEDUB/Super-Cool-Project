Submission checklist (paste into your repo’s README)
▢ Repo public to instructor/TAs; all teammates added

▢ Finalized code (making it a tagged release is cool (e.g., v1.0)) by the due date

▢ Tests included and passing
▢ Presentation slides or short outline of demo attached to assignment submission (optional)
